# Summary

UD_Yupik-SLI is a treebank of St. Lawrence Island Yupik (ISO 639-3: ess) that has been manually annotated at the morpheme level, based on a finite-state morphological analyzer by [Chen et al., 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.326).
The word-level annotation, merging multiword expressions, is provided in not-to-release/ess_sli-ud-test.merged.conllu.
More information about the treebank can be found in our publication (AmericasNLP, 2021).

# Introduction

The current version contains dependency annotations for end-of-chapter exercises in *A practical grammar of the St. Lawrence Island/Siberian Yupik Eskimo language* (Jacobson, 2001).
